- **Integration Services**: onboarding, migration, and workflow customization.

> This document intentionally omits pricing formulas, customer-specific metrics, and proprietary optimization logic.

## Safe Sample Snippets (Public-safe)
```js
// Example: local diagnostics contract (no business logic leakage)
const diagnostics = {
  runId: 'local-run-001',
  ai: { model: 'local', loaded: true },
  extraction: { attempts: 3, bestPlanId: 'plan_2' }
};
```

```js
// Example: attachment token normalization (abstracted)
function normalizeAttachmentToken(input) {
  return String(input || '').trim().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
}
```

## Handover Essentials
- Read `docs/AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/SECURITY.md` first.
- Validate gates in `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` before merge.
- Use `pts_map.json` for targeted test execution.
